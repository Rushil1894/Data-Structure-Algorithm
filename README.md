 Folder Descriptions
🔹 ArrayListImplementation

Custom implementation and usage examples of ArrayList, including basic operations and internal working concepts.

🔹 Arrays

Array-based problems such as traversal, searching, insertion, deletion, and common interview questions.

🔹 BinaryTree

Binary Tree implementations and operations like traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder), height, depth, and basic tree problems.

🔹 Hashing

Programs demonstrating hashing concepts using HashMap, HashSet, frequency counting, and collision-handling problems.

🔹 Linked_list

Singly linked list operations such as insertion, deletion, reversal, traversal, and problem-based implementations.

🔹 Practice

Miscellaneous practice problems combining multiple data structures and algorithmic concepts.

🔹 QUEUEIMPLEMENT

Queue implementations using arrays, linked lists, stacks, and problems like circular queue and deque.

🔹 Recursion

Recursive solutions for classic problems like factorial, Fibonacci, string reversal, and backtracking basics.

🔹 STACKIMPLEMENT

Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists, including applications like expression evaluation and balanced parentheses.

🔹 Sorting_Algorithm

Sorting techniques such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort with examples.

🔹 Strings

String manipulation problems including reversal, palindrome check, substring operations, and pattern matching.

🔹 TwoD_matrix

2D array and matrix-related problems like traversal, transpose, addition, and searching in matrices.
